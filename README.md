## 👋 I'm Erick Goldberg!

.NET Developer | Systems Architecture Student | Focused on becoming a Software Architect 

I currently work as a .NET developer, with experience in creating scalable and efficient solutions using technologies such as AWS, Azure, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and SQL Server.  
I'm pursuing a postgraduate degree in .NET Systems Architecture, and my goal is to become a software architect, applying clean architecture principles and microservices to build robust, high-performance systems.

I'm always looking for new challenges, knowledge, and diverse experiences — constantly adapting and learning every day.
